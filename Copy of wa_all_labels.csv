38,"*WEDDING IN RUSSIA*By Sudha Murthy( Wife of Mr Narayan Murthy of Infosys )👇Recently I was in Moscow, Russia.The Day I Went to the Park, it was aSunday.It was Drizzling and Cold, though it was Summer.I was Standing under an Umbrella and Enjoying the Beauty of the Place... when Suddenly, My Eyes Fell on a Young Couple.It Was Apparent that They Had Just Got Married.The Girl was in Her Mid-Twenties, Slim and with Blonde Hair and Sparkling Blue Eyes. She Was Very Beautiful Indeed.The Boy Was almost the Same Age and Very Handsome. He Was in a Military Uniform.The Bride was Wearing a Pretty White Satin Dress, Decorated with Pearls and Pretty Laces.Two Young Bridesmaids were Standing Behind Her Holding up the Hem of the Wedding Gown, so as not to let it get Dirtied.One Young Boy was Holding an Umbrella Over Their Heads, so that They Should Not Get Drenched.The Girl was Holding a Bouquet and the Two Were Standing with Their Arms Linked.It Was a Beautiful Sight. I  Wondered why They Had Come to the Park in This Rain Soon After Getting Married. They Could Surely Have Gone to a Merrier Place.I Watched as They Walked Together to the Raised Platform Near the Memorial, placed the Bouquet, Bowed their Heads in Silence, and Slowly Walked Back.By Now I was  Curious to Know as to What Was Going On...There was an Old Man Standing With Them. He Looked at Me, My Saree, and asked, ‘Are you Indian ?’I replied, ‘Yes, I am an Indian.’And We Began Chatting Amicably. I Decided to use the Opportunity to ask some Questions. - ‘ How Do You Come to Know English ?’ - ‘ Oh, I Worked Abroad.' - ‘ Please Tell Me Why that Young Couple Visited the War Memorial on Their Wedding Day ?’ - ‘ Oh, that is the Custom in Russia. The Wedding takes Place Normally on a Saturday or a Sunday.'Irrespective of the Season, after Signing the Register at the Marriage Office, Married Couples Must visit the Important National Monuments Nearby.'Every Boy in this Country Has to Serve in the Military for a Couple of Years at Least.Regardless of His Position, He Must Wear His Service Uniform for the Wedding.’ ‘Why is That ?’ 'This is a Mark of Gratitude.Our Forefathers Have Given their Lives in Various Wars That Russia Has Fought.Some of Them We Won, and Some We Lost, But Their Sacrifice Was Always for the Country.The Newly Married Couple Needs to Remember That They are Living in a Peaceful, Independent Russia Because of Their Ancestors’ Sacrifices. They Must Ask for Their Blessings.'Love for the Country is More Important Than Wedding Celebrations.We Elders Insist on Continuing with this Tradition Whether it be in Moscow, St. Petersburg or any other Part of Russia.On the Wedding Day They Have to Visit the Nearest War Memorial.’This Set Me Wondering about What We Teach Our Children Here.Do We Indians Have the Courtesy to Remember Our Martyrs on the Most Important Day of our Lives ?We are Busy Shopping for Sarees, Buying Jewellery and Planning & Preparing Elaborate Menus and Partying in Discos etc..My Eyes filled with Tears at the Thought.. and I Wished that We Indians Could Learn a Lesson From the Russians in This Noble Thought and Custom..And We Too Could  Respect Our Martyrs Who Sacrificed Their Lives For Our Nation.. and For Our Today and Tomorrow Too...And From the Heart...!🙏🙏🙏Please Do Share Widely..If You Agree With The Sentiment Expressed... 👆",1,1,1,1,1,1
39,"Found this beauty among the countless 'New Year' forwards. A MUST read on new year :....................................I woke up today, having dreamt early morning at 4 AM. I was in the Mall looking to buy a pair of socks and a neck tie.As I walked in, I noticed a sweater with a price tag of RS 9000. Next to the sweater were a pair of Jeans for Rs.10000. The socks were Rs.8000! And Tie for astonishing 16,000.I went looking for a salesperson and found one in the watch Dept. He was showing a man a Rs. 225 Rolex watch. I looked in the glass case and there was a 4 carat diamond ring also on sales for Rs.95.Shocked I asked the salesperson ""How could a Rolex watch sell for Rs.225 and a cheap pair of socks sell for Rs. 8000""?He said ""Someone slid into the store last night and: changed the price tag on everything. Everyone is confused, people are acting like they have lost their sense of value. They are willing to pay lots of money for things of little value and very little money for things of great value. It's like they don't know what is really valuable and what's not. I hope we get the price tags back-on right soon. I really pity, seeing people paying way too much for things of little value "".I woke up startled & confused and thinking since then ...Maybe our life is like this dream.Maybe someone slid into our lives and: changed the price on everything.Maybe they marked up the value of competition, position, titles, fame, promotion, show-off, money, and power ! And put a huge discount on the value of Happiness, Family, Relationships, Peace of mind, Contentment, Love , Knowledge, Kindness, Friendships.Maybe we are all living this dream...I hope we wake up well in-time! And start our New Year on this fresh note!!",1,1,1,1,1,1

A damn rat got picked over actual children at an orphanage and he’s supposed to be a hero? And I can’t even tell you how many damn times I’ve seen a great parking space only to turn the corner and realise Stuart Little is already parked there in his stupid little fucking convertible. He took my wife and the kids and my house and my job. I swear to fucking god, I’m going to kill myself and take that goddamn rodent to hell with me. Stuart Little has ruined my family. Last summer, I approached the miserable mouse in the street, and asked him for his autograph, because my son is a huge fan. The fucking rat gave me the autograph and told me to burn in hell. Later, when I gave my son the autograph he started crying and said he hated me. Turns out the mousefucker didnt write his autograph, no, he wrote “you’re a piece of shit, and i fucked your mom”. I’m now divorced, and planning a huge class-action lawsuit against the white devil that ruined my life. Your time is almost over, Stuart.

You’re really tired, upset and frustrated.3. Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to drag out into your arm and up in to your jaw. You are only about five km from the hospital nearest your home.4. Unfortunately you don’t know if you’ll be able to make it that far.5. You have been trained in CPR, but the guy who taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself.6. HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE?Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has onlyabout 10 seconds: left before losing consciousness.7. However, these victims can help themselves by coughingrepeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest.A breath and a cough must be repeated about every twoseconds without let-up until help arrives, or untilthe heart is felt to be beating normally again.8. Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughingmovements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital.9. Tell as many other people as possible about this. It could save their lives!!10. A cardiologist says If everyone who gets this mailkindly send it to 10 people, you can bet that we’ll save at least one life.11.

We do not interfere in each other's decisions.""Still not convinced, I asked him ""Give me some examples"".He said ""Smaller issues like, which car we should buy, how much amount to save, when to visit the super market, when to go on vacation, which sofa, air conditioner, refrigerator to buy. Monthly expenses, whether to keep a maid or not etc. Are all decided by my wife. I just agree to it ""I asked ""Then, what is your role?""He said ""My decisions are only for very big issues. Like whether America should attack Iran, whether Britain should lift sanctions over Zimbabwe, whether to widen the Sri Lankan economy, whether Virat Kohli should retire from Cricket etc etc. and do you know, my wife, NEVER, objects to any of these decisions""😄😛😂",1,1,1,1,1,1

329,"A woman decides to have a facelift for her 50th birthday. She spends $15,000 and feels pretty good about the results. On her way home, she stops at a news stand to buy a newspaper. Before leaving, she says to the clerk,“I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?”“About 32,” is the reply.“Nope! I’m exactly 50,” the woman says happily.A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question. The girl replies,“I’d guess about 29.”The woman replies with a big smile,“Nope, I’m 50.”Now she’s feeling really good about herself. She stops in a drug store on her way down the street. She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the clerk this burning question. The clerk responds,“Oh, I’d say 30.”Again she proudly responds,“I’m 50, but thank you!”While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question. He replies,“I’m 78 and my eyesight is going. Although, when I was young, there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. If you permit me to put my hands under your bra, then, and only then can I tell you EXACTLY how old you are.”They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the best of her.She finally blurts out,“What the hell, go ahead.”He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.After a couple of minutes of this, she says,“Okay, okay…How old am I?”He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ” Ma dam, you are 50.”Stunned and amazed, the woman says,“That was incredible, how could you tell?”The old man says,“Promise you won’t get mad?”“I promise I won’t,” she says.“I was behind you in McDonald’s.”",1,1,1,1,1,1

399,"Guys this happened to me.. please read and be aware..My intention of this post is not to criticize or sham our system, law, judiciary, or police.I'm writing this just to make car owners aware of such law.. I'm sure most of them like me are unaware of this law..Today I was fined by our country's court of law just because I helped some people who were in need.On Monday Morning (18th June 2018) when I was on my way to office.. I saw few office goers near Airoli Circle desperately looking for a lift as it was raining heavily and all public transport was either crowded or late..One of them was an elderly (at least 60+) person and other two guys were working for a reputed IT company (I could make out from their Office ID card). I stopped by the side of the road. They said that they wanted to go to Gandhi Nagar. I asked them to get in,  as Gandhi Nagar was on my way to the office.The moment they got in and I started the car, One traffic Police officer in a towing vehicle waylaid me and asked me to show him my license. At first, I thought that probably I stopped in a no parking area...The police officer then started to write a receipt and asked me to hand over my license to him. I asked him for the reason.. to which he said ""It is illegal to give a lift to unknown people""I thought that he must be just making it up and wants to make some money from me. But he was serious.. He took my license and gave me the receipt.  He asked me to go to the police station next day, pay the fine, and get the license back.To which I agreed.Next day (Tuesday) I went to the police station to get my license. There I was informed that I need to go to court to get the license back as the section under which they are charging me is 66/192. Under this section, I have to go to court,  accept that I did a mistake in front of a judge,  pay the fine in court and get my license back.I consulted one of my lawyer friends to ensure that the police guys are not taking me for a ride... But the lawyer confirmed that Indeed we have a law that makes it illegal to give a lift to an unknown person in a private vehicle.. (What a draconian law !!!)Today (Friday 22nd June 2018), I was called to the court at 10 AM by the Police guy.. I went there at 9.30 AM and they made me sit in the court corridor till 1 PM (looking at handcuffed criminals and dance bar girls being escorted in the court) At 1 PM I was called inside the court room.. I had to stand there as if I was some criminal in front of the judge, with the courtroom filled with lawyers and other people discussing their respective cases (Yes!! It was very filmy).  The judge called out my name and I have to accept my mistake and come out of the courtroom. Felt pathetic .. :(I was fined Rs. 2000 for giving a lift to unknown people and using my car as a passenger car. Bullshit!!!!After lot of request they  reduced my fine to Rs. 1500.. (A discount of Rs. 500..Ohh what a courtesy!!)🤣After this, I had to again go back to the police station to collect my license..  I reached there by 2.. got to know that 1 to 3 is their lunch time..  So I have to go there again after 3 PM.. Finally I got my license back today at 5 PM.If such is the law of our country then no one will help a person even if he is dying on the road...I'm not writing to debate what is right or wrong but to make you guys aware that ""Our country doesn't want us to help our fellow countrymen""Regards,Nitin Nair",1,1,1,1,1,1

471,"Zomatos reply...Last night, we came across a video of a delivery executive in a Zomato t-shirt, carrying a Zomato delivery bag, eating food out of boxed orders and replacing each one after resealing them, back into the delivery bag. The video suggests that he consumed some of the food meant for delivery to users, on his way to the drop points.We want our users, restaurant partners and all stakeholders to know that –1. We take these kinds of reports extremely seriously and upon thorough investigation, we’ve found that the video was shot in Madurai. The person in the video happened to be a delivery partner on our fleet. We have spoken to him at length – and while we understand that this was a human error in judgement, we have taken him off our platform.2. We would like to iterate that given our multiple communication channels with users, who expect the highest standards from Zomato and highlight the smallest of deviations to us as soon as they receive their orders, this is highly unusual and a rare case.3. Unfortunately, this also highlights a real possibility for tampering with the food on the way to delivery from a restaurant. We take this very seriously and will soon introduce tamper-proof tapes, and other precautionary measures to ensure we add an extra layer of safeguard against such behaviour. Additionally, we will educate our delivery fleet of over 1.5 lakh partners to highlight or escalate any such deviations to us, while also encouraging our users — the custodians of our platform — to highlight the smallest of anomalies to us.4. And finally, our delivery partners are the face of our brand, and the heart of our success in growing to become the largest food delivery platform in the country. Our food delivery business has grown immensely over the last year on the back of our large delivery partner fleet that work very hard to ensure that Zomato translates to a high quality food experience. We thank them and the strong support and trust from our restaurant partners, consumers and investors.Zomato maintains a zero tolerance policy for tampering of food. This particular incident, while unfortunate, only makes our commitment to fleet training, scheduling and process even stronger. We stand behind our extensive fleet who do the right thing across many hours of the day.",1,1,1,1,1,1

One can find material things, but there is one thing that can not be found when it is lost - ""life"".Treat yourself well, and cherish others. As we get older we are smarter, and we slowly realize that the watch is worth $ 30 or $ 300 - both of which show the same time.Whether we carry a purse worth $ 30 or $ 300 - the amount of money in the wallets are the same. Whether we drive a car worth $ 150,000, or a car worth $ 30,000 - the road and distance are the same, we reach the same destination.If we drink a bottle worth $ 300 or wine worth $ 10 - the ""stroller"" will be the same.If the house we live in is 300 square meters, or 3000 square meters - the loneliness is the same.Your true inner happiness does not come from the material things of this world. Whether you're flying first class, or economy class - if the plane crashes, you crash with it.So, I hope you understand that when you have friends or someone to talk to - this is true happiness!Five Undeniable Facts-1. Do not educate your children to be rich. Educate them to be happy. - So when they grow up they will know the value of things, not the price.2. Eat your food as medicine, otherwise you will need to eat your medicine as food.3. Whoever loves you will never leave you, even if he has 100 reasons to give up. He will always find one reason to hold on.4. There is a big difference between being human and human being.5. If you want to go fast - go alone! But if you want to go far - go together!And in conclusion,The six best doctors in the world.1. Sunlight2. Rest3. Exercise4. Diet5. Self-confidence6.

778,It is indirectly affected as way of walking changes for a person for different depths.And sir don't you think that while walking to and fro motion forward acceleration ( component ) is more important than downwards.When walking normally and phone is in hand ( which is like replicating the motion of simple pendulum )And we have learnt from it that their( gravity and forward acceleration) net result give motion to the pendulum.Thus I want to say to get independency of holding the phone we should calculate forward vector.So their net resolution that is resultant of net down vector and net forward vector would give actual acceleration of it wrt time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
779,And that is why graph ( down vector) didn't show any proper distinction for the various heights.Coz it's almost same for all heights.And you are correct further resolution would give us more distinct graphs.But resultant vector of down and forward should give us distinct graphs at this resolution also,0,0,0,0,0,0
780,Sir so this is what I suggest -1) I work on our model again. make an absolute new model as I want to correct my mistake of leaving one hot encoding.And try to get better accuracy2) In the mean time I request you to look for a similar paper to get the way to calculate forward vector.3) And Ujjawal can continue with collecting dataset as he has already started with collection.,0,0,0,0,0,0

1606,"I woke up today, having dreamt early morning at 4 AM. I was in the Mall looking to buy a pair of socks and a neck tie.As I walked in, I noticed a sweater with a price tag of RS 9000. Next to the sweater were a pair of Jeans for Rs.10000. The socks were Rs.8000! And Tie for astonishing 16,000.I went looking for a salesperson and found one in the watch Dept. He was showing a man a Rs. 225 Rolex watch. I looked in the glass case and there was a 4 carat diamond ring also on sales for Rs.95.Shocked I asked the salesperson ""How could a Rolex watch sell for Rs.225 and a cheap pair of socks sell for Rs. 8000""?He said ""Someone slid into the store last night and changed the price tag on everything. Everyone is confused, people are acting like they have lost their sense of value. They are willing to pay lots of money for things of little value and very little money for things of great value. It's like they don't know what is really valuable and what's not. I hope we get the price tags back-on right soon. I really pity, seeing people paying way too much for things of little value "".I woke up startled & confused and thinking since then ...Maybe our life is like this dream.Maybe someone slid into our lives and changed the price on everything.Maybe they marked up the value of competition, position, titles, fame, promotion, show-off, money, and power ! And put a huge discount on the value of Happiness, Family, Relationships, Peace of mind, Contentment, Love , Knowledge, Kindness, Friendships.Maybe we are all living this dream...I hope we wake up well in-time!

Again nothing happened.Then  Tiger caught a man who had entered the washroom while balancing a tray of teacups in one hand. Within 15 minutes a huge hue and cry ensued, and everyone in the office started looking for the man. The search team reached the washroom, flushed out the Tiger and saved the unconscious man.

2574,"Zomatos reply...Last night, we came across a video of a delivery executive in a Zomato t-shirt, carrying a Zomato delivery bag, eating food out of boxed orders and replacing each one after resealing them, back into the delivery bag. The video suggests that he consumed some of the food meant for delivery to users, on his way to the drop points.We want our users, restaurant partners and all stakeholders to know that â€“1. We take these kinds of reports extremely seriously and upon thorough investigation, weâ€™ve found that the video was shot in Madurai. The person in the video happened to be a delivery partner on our fleet. We have spoken to him at length â€“ and while we understand that this was a human error in judgement, we have taken him off our platform.2. We would like to iterate that given our multiple communication channels with users, who expect the highest standards from Zomato and highlight the smallest of deviations to us as soon as they receive their orders, this is highly unusual and a rare case.3. Unfortunately, this also highlights a real possibility for tampering with the food on the way to delivery from a restaurant. We take this very seriously and will soon introduce tamper-proof tapes, and other precautionary measures to ensure we add an extra layer of safeguard against such behaviour. Additionally, we will educate our delivery fleet of over 1.5 lakh partners to highlight or escalate any such deviations to us, while also encouraging our users â€” the custodians of our platform â€” to highlight the smallest of anomalies to us.4. And finally, our delivery partners are the face of our brand, and the heart of our success in growing to become the largest food delivery platform in the country. Our food delivery business has grown immensely over the last year on the back of our large delivery partner fleet that work very hard to ensure that Zomato translates to a high quality food experience. We thank them and the strong support and trust from our restaurant partners, consumers and investors.Zomato maintains a zero tolerance policy for tampering of food. This particular incident, while unfortunate, only makes our commitment to fleet training, scheduling and process even stronger. We stand behind our extensive fleet who do the right thing across many hours of the day.",1,1,1,1,1,1

As a part of this they would like a puliya/workshop conducted by a female in some of the chapters and to promote the event.Since this is a free event and meant to be for promoting women in our domain, I like the idea too. However as they want to collaborate across chapters, I have floated this across the mods group. If this goes through, can we do this in our chapter in Jan?Would like to know your thoughts on this",0,0,0,0,0,0

2687,"Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and kills uncounted thousands of people every year. Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. For those who have become dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death.Dihydrogen monoxide:is also known as hydroxl acid, and is the major component of acid rain.contributes to the ""greenhouse effect.""may cause severe burns.contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.Contamination Is Reaching Epidemic Proportions!Quantities of dihydrogen monoxide have been found in almost every stream, lake, and reservoir in America today. But the pollution is global, and the contaminant has even been found in Antarctic ice. DHMO has caused millions of dollars of property damage in the US.Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:as an industrial solvent and coolant.in nuclear power plants.in the production of styrofoam.as a fire retardant.in many forms of cruel animal research.in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.as an additive in certain ""junk-foods"" and other food products.Companies dump waste DHMO into rivers and the ocean, and nothing can be done to stop them because this practice is still legal. The impact on wildlife is extreme, and we cannot afford to ignore it any longer!The American government has refused to ban the production, distribution, or use of this damaging chemical due to its ""importance to the economic health of this nation."" In fact, the navy and other military organizations are conducting experiments with DHMO, and designing multi-billion dollar devices to control and utilize it during warfare situations. Hundreds of military research facilities receive tons of it through a highly sophisticated underground distribution network. Many store large quantities for later use.The Horror Must Be Stopped!Act NOW to prevent further contamination. Find out more about this dangerous chemical. What you don't know can hurt you and others throughout the world.",1,1,1,1,1,1

2788,"Modi writes about himselfMy family of 8 lived in a 40x12 feet house – it was small, but enough for us. Our days began early, around 5 AM when my mother would provide traditional forms of curing and healing to newborns and small children. Through the night my brother and I would take turns to keep the ‘chula’ going for her to use. She didn’t have the fortune of getting an education, but God was kind and she had a special way of curing ailments. Mothers would line up outside our house every morning because she was known for her healing touch.Then, I would open my father’s tea stall at the railway station, clean up and head off to school. As soon as school ended, I would rush back to help him, but what I really looked forward to was meeting people from all over the country. I would serve them tea and listen to their stories – that’s how I learnt to speak Hindi. I would hear some traders speak about ‘Bambai’ and wonder, ‘Will I ever get to see the city of dreams?’",1,1,1,1,1,1
2789,"I was always curious – I would go to the library and read everything I could get my hands on. I was 8 when I attended my first RSS meeting, and 9 when I was a part of an effort for the betterment of the lives of others – I set up a food stall with my friends to help the victims of the floods in parts of Gujarat. I wanted to do more, but I was aware that we had little means.Still, even at that age, I strongly believed that God has made us all alike. It didn’t matter what circumstances I was born into, I could be something more. So when you ask me, what my struggles were, I’ll tell you that I had none. I came from nothing, I knew no luxury and hadn’t seen a ‘better’ life, so in my small world...I was happy.If the way was ever difficult, I made my own way. I had a great need to look sharp and groomed. So, even though we couldn’t afford an iron, I would heat some coal, use an old ‘lota’, wrap a cloth around it and press my clothes – the effect was the same, then why complain?This was the beginning of everything that I am today and I didn’t even know it at the time. So if you ask the 8 year old Narendra Modi, running around serving chai and cleaning his father’s tea stall, whether he even dared to dream about becoming the Prime Minister of India, his answer would be no. Never. It was too far to even think about.",1,1,1,1,1,1
2790,"While growing up, I had a lot of curiosity but very little clarity. I would see army men in their uniforms and think that this was the the only way to serve the country. But as my conversations with the saints and sadhus at the railway station grew deeper, I realised that this too was a world worth discovering.I was undecided, unguided and unclear -- I didn’t know where I wanted to go, what I wanted to do and why I wanted to do it. But all I knew, was that I wanted to do something. So I surrendered myself to God and left for the Himalayas at the age of 17. I bid goodbye to my parents as my mother gave me a sweet dish before I left and put a tilak on my forehead to bless my journey.I went wherever God wanted to take me -- it was an undecided period of my life but still, gave me so many answers. I sought to understand the world, to understand myself. I travelled far and wide, spent time at the Ramkrishna Mission, met sadhus and saints, stayed with them and began a discovery, inwards. I moved from place to place -- I had no roof above my head, but still never felt more at home.I would wake up during Brahma Mahurat, between 3 and 3:45 am, and take a bath in the freezing waters of the Himalayas, but still feel the warmth. I learnt that peace, oneness and Dhyan can be found, even in the simple sound of a waterfall. The sadhus I lived with taught me to align myself with the rhythm of the Universe.So that’s what I did -- I aligned and experienced revelations that help me till today. I realised that we’re all tied down by our thoughts and limitations. When you surrender and stand in front of the vastness -- you know that you’re a small part of a large universe. When you understand that, any trace of arrogance you have in you melts and then life truly begins.That’s when it all changed. After two years, I returned home with clarity and a guiding force to lead the way.After coming back from the Himalayas, I knew that I wanted my life to be one that is lived in the service of others. Within a short span of returning, I left for Ahmedabad. It was my first brush with living in a big city – the pace of life was very different. I began my time there by occasionally helping my uncle at his canteen.",1,1,1,1,1,1
2791,"Eventually, I became a full time Pracharak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. There, I got the opportunity to interact with people from different walks of life and do a wide range of work. We all took turns to clean the RSS office, prepare tea and food for colleagues and clean utensils.Life was rigorous and busy. But amidst all of my duties, I was determined to not let go of my learnings from the Himalayas. To ensure that this new phase of life didn’t take over the sense of peace that I achieved there, I decided to take out some time every year and introspect. It was my way of maintaining a balanced life.Not many people know this, but I would go away for the 5 days of Diwali. Somewhere in a jungle – a place with only clean water and no people. I would pack enough food to last for those 5 days. There would be no radio’s or newspapers, and during that time, there was no TV or internet anyway. I would reflect – and the strength that this alone time gave me still helps me to handle life and its various experiences. People often asked me, ‘Who are you going to meet?’ And I would say, ‘मैं मुझसे मिलने जा रहा हूं।’Which is why, I always urge everyone, especially my young friends, in the midst of your fast paced life and busy schedules, take some time off…think and introspect. It will change your perception – you will understand your inner self better. You will start living in the true sense of the word. It will also make you more confident and undeterred by what others say about you. All of these things will help you in times to come. So I just want each and every one of you to remember that you are special and that you don’t have to look outside for the light...it’s already within you.",1,1,1,1,1,1

We should have this disclaimer(written or not) that timings may change. I don't think it in anyway means we are unreliable. Infact it means we will ensure the audience won't waste their time in some random session we brought in last moment. Also when we commit to a talk and expect a lead to do that, we will have to have one of the leads commit to 1. always be in the meets all year round(no exception) 2. have a new unique session everytime with slides etc ready with the same quality as the audience expects of the chapter.",0,0,0,0,0,0

3451,"From Whatsapp:What a nice idea!Swiss Time BankA student studying in Switzerlandobserves:While studying inSwitzerland,I rented a house near the school.The landlady Kristina is a67-year-old singleold lady who had worked as a teacher in a secondary school before she retired.Switzerland's pension isvery good, enough to not worry herabout food and shelter in her later years.However, she actually found ""work"" - to take care of an 87-year-old single old man.I asked if she wasworking for money.Her answer surprised me: “I do not work for money, but I put my time inthe ‘time bank’, andwhen I cannot move in my old age,I could withdraw it.”The first time I heard about this concept of ""time bank"", I was verycurious and askedthe landlady more.The original “Time Bank” was an old-age pension program developedby the Swiss Federal Ministry of Social Security. People saved the'time' taking care ofthe elderly whenthey were younger, and when they were old, ill or needed care could withdraw it.Applicants must be healthy, good at communicatingand full of love.Everyday they have to look after the elderly who need help.Their service hours will be deposited into the personal 'time' accounts of the social security system.She went to work twice a week, spending twohours each time helping theelderly, shopping, cleaningtheir room, taking them out to sunbathe,chatting with them.According to the agreement, after one year of herservice, “Time Bank” will calculate her working hours and issue hera “time bank card”.When she needs someone to take care of her,she can useher “time bank card” to “time towithdraw “time and time interest”. After the informationverification, “Time Bank” will assign other volunteers to take care of her at the hospital or her home.One day, I was in school and the landlady called and said she felloff the stool whenshe was wiping the window.I quickly took leave and sent her to the hospital for treatment.The landlady broke her ankle and needed to stay in bed for a while.While I was preparing toapply for a home to take care of her,the landlady told me that I need not worry about her.She had already submitted a withdrawal request to the “Time Bank”.Sure enough, in less than two hours ""Time Bank""sent a nursing worker to come and care for the landlady.In the following month, the care worker took careof the landlady everyday, chatted with her and made delicious meals for her.Under the meticulous careof the carer, the landlady soon recovered her health.After recovering, the landlady went back to ""work"".She said that she intends to save more time in the ""time bank"" while she is still healthy.Today, in Switzerland,the use of ""time banks"" to support old age has become a common practice.This not only saves the country pension expenses, but also solves other social problems.Many Swiss citizens are very supportive of this kind of old-age pensions.The survey conducted by the Swiss pension organization shows that more than half of Swiss people alsowant to participate in this type of old-age care service.The Swiss government also passed legislation to support the ""Time Bank"" pension scheme.At present the number of ""empty-nest old people"" in Asiancountries are increasing and it has graduallybecome a social problem.Switzerland style ""time bank"" pension may be a good option for us too.📯📯📯📯📯📯Wat an interesting concept..... hope it gets adapted all over d world soon!!! 🙂🙂",1,1,1,1,1,1

But, this one is important.-----------------------------------A seven-year-old boy was at the center of a Bangalore courtroom drama yesterday:When he challenged a court ruling over who should have custody of him. The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulations requiring that family unity be maintained to the degree possibleThe boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried out that they also beat him.After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.After two recesses to check legal references and confer with child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Royal Challengers Bangalore franchise, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.😂😂😂",1,1,1,1,1,1

But, this one is important.-----------------------------------A seven-year-old boy was at the center of a Bangalore courtroom drama yesterday:When he challenged a court ruling over who should have custody of him. The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulations requiring that family unity be maintained to the degree possibleThe boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried out that they also beat him.After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.After two recesses to check legal references and confer with child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Royal Challengers Bangalore franchise, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.😂😂😂😂😂",1,1,1,1,1,1

Love is not an agreement. It’s not a label.Love is sharing. Love is caring. It’s when you tell your heart to let out the love stored within it and spread it to every grain of blood in your body. Then comes a time when love begins to overflow. Then you find someone to share it with. It’s not agreement. It is natural companionship.The source? It’s just simple self-love. The heart does what it loves. The mind can worry all it wants about the results/outcomes. The heart just follows the journey for the sake of the beautiful flow.All love is sourced from within. It can only be poured when the bodily cup is full. Love is divine. It is miraculous. It is instant. It is revolutionary. It has no ending when it starts. It’s a miracle that those who believe in magic receive.The light of true love can only be witnessed after a period of blackness and agony. When life’s purpose comes into fruition.The body and mind is just a cover. What is within, the soul, is eternal. It carries with it love wherever it goes. We are souls distracted by material obsessions. Love is spiritual. It makes you believe in God.Love is not a person. It is a spirit. When you connect with your soul, it attracts the spirit of love. You’re greater than the cover you’re in at the moment. You begin to understand that God is within and you are within everything you see. You begin to love God. You begin to love life. You begin to cherish your worth and all the obstacles that got you here.What was a little loneliness when it comes to this divine sensation of love spraying the heavenly gardens within?” ",1,1,1,1,1,1

Music is life.*5.* If in a fight, hit first and hit hard.*6.* Don't expect life to be fair.*7.* Never give up on anybody. Miracles happen everyday.*8.* Always accept an outstretched hand.*9.* Be brave. Even if you're not, pretend to be.

We encourage students do in groups and learn with / support each other.We request you to please share the below with your students and CS/relevant faculty.Thank you,Placement Office___________________________TEMPLATE TO FORWARD TO STUDENTS__________________________________Hello,As you are aware, we conduct Kick Start, a Code Jam competition that gives participants the opportunity to develop and grow their coding skills to explore a career at Google. Each round invites students and industry professionals to solve algorithmic challenges designed by Google engineers—you can participate in one, or join them all. Kickstart is a great way for students to not only have fun, but also get a glimpse into the programming skills needed for a technical career at Google. The top participants from each round may be contacted by a Google recruiter. The next round is scheduled for July 29th, 2018. Please register via the website.Prepare with a codelab (duration ~2-3 hours)We've prepared a small codelab (a tutorial combining explanation, working example code, and code exercise) to cover some basic algorithms which will help in the upcoming rounds.For the codelab, you would need an internet connection and basic programming skills in a language of your choice, and of course, a little enthusiasm and energy to get through the codelab. We recommend having facilitators (a faculty or a fellow student) who can help if needed, and pursue the codelab as a group exercise. If you're a facilitator, it would be nice to brush up on some combinatorics, dynamic programming (DP) and geometry skills. The time it would take a student to finish the codelab would depend on their current understanding and skill, but to err on the safe side, be ready to put in 2-3 hours.Sign-up for the Codelab by 23rd JulyPlease sign-up via this form and we will send you the codelab material via email. Do the codelab before July 28th and participate in the Kick Start round on July 29th. We recommend that you work on the codelab in groups so that it's both fun and you can learn from one another. Do it at your convenience! And plan on having a facilitator (a faculty or a fellow student) who can help if needed.Feedback/QuestionsWhen we send the codelab via email, we will also send a link to a feedback form. Any concepts that are difficult or if you have questions about specific problems, please share/ask via the feedback form. We will address the concepts/questions as part of a livestream that we are hosting in early August.Post July 29thWe will host a Youtube livestream, in which we'll cover questions/concepts asked in the codelab exercise, discuss problems, common tips and tricks, strategies and general Q&A regarding Kick Start. We will share the livestream link with everyone who signs up for the codelab.Thank you,Talent & Outreach Programs TeamGoogle India",0,0,0,0,0,0

And what if you deploy one of your trainee-dentists to do the extraction, without anesthetic? Dentist: Well, I cannot guarantee professionalism and it also would be painful. But the price could drop down to Rs 150. Lady: Hmm. What if you make it like a training-session, like one of your students does the extraction, while the other students watch and learn?

You’re really tired, upset and frustrated.3. Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to drag out into your arm and up in to your jaw. You are only about five km from the hospital nearest your home.4. Unfortunately you don’t know if you’ll be able to make it that far.5. You have been trained in CPR, but the guy who taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself.6. HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE?Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has onlyabout 10 seconds left before losing consciousness.7. However, these victims can help themselves by coughingrepeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest.A breath and a cough must be repeated about every twoseconds without let-up until help arrives, or untilthe heart is felt to be beating normally again.8. Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughingmovements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital.9. Tell as many other people as possible about this. It could save their lives!!10. A cardiologist says If everyone who gets this mailkindly send it to 10 people, you can bet that we’ll save at least one life.11. Rather than sending jokes, please..contribute by forwarding this mail which can save a person’s life….12. If this message comes around you ……more than once…..please don’t get irritated……U need to be happy that you have many friends who care about you & being reminded of how to tackle….Heart attacks….AGAIN…From:DR.N Siva(Senior cardiologistU might save lives..😊",1,1,1,1,1,1

6736,"*Dr Aloysius LOH:**LIFE AFTER 60**An interesting article.*Life can begin at 60, it is all in your hands! Many people feel unhappy, health-wise and security-wise, after 60 years of age, owing to the diminishing importance given to them and their opinions. But, it need not be so, if only we understand the basic principles of life and follow them scrupulously. Here are ten mantras to age gracefully and make life after retirement pleasant.*1. Never say I am aged' :*There are three ages, chronological, biological, and psychological. The first is calculated based on our date of birth; the second is determined by the health conditions; the third is how old we feel we are. While we don't have control over the first, we can take care of our health with good diet, exercise and a cheerful attitude. A positive attitude and optimistic thinking can reverse the third age.*2. Health is wealth:*If you really love your kith and kin, taking care of your health should be your priority. Thus, you will not be a burden to them. Have an annual health check-up and take the prescribed medicines regularly. Do take health insurance coverage.*3. Money is important:*Money is essential for meeting the basic necessities of life, keeping good health and earning family respect and security. Don't spend beyond your means even for your children. You have lived for them all through and it is time you enjoyed a harmonious life with your spouse. If your children are grateful and they take care of you, you are blessed. But, never take it for granted.*4. Relaxation and recreation:*The most relaxing and recreating forces are a healthy religious attitude, good sleep, music and laughter. Have faith in God, learn to sleep well, love good music and see the funny side of life.*5. Time is precious:*It is almost like holding a horses' reins. When they are in your hands, you can control them. Imagine that everyday you are born again. Yesterday is a cancelled cheque. Tomorrow is a promissory note. Today is ready cash - use it profitably. Live this moment; live it fully, now, in the present time.*6. Change is the only permanent thing:* We should accept change - it is inevitable. The only way to make sense out of change is to join in the dance. Change has brought about many pleasant things. We should be happy that our children are blessed.*7. Enlightened selfishness:*All of us are basically selfish. Whatever we do, we expect something in return. We should definitely be grateful to those who stood by us. But, our focus should be on the internal satisfaction and the happiness we derive by doing good for others, without expecting anything in return. Perform a random act of kindness daily.*8. Forget and forgive:*Don't be bothered too much about others' mistakes. We are not spiritual enough to show our other cheek when we are slapped in one. But for the sake of our own health and happiness, let us forgive and forget them. Otherwise, we will be only increasing our blood pressure.*9. Everything has a purpose:*Take life as it comes. Accept yourself as you are and also accept others for what they are. Everybody is unique and is right in his own way.*10. Overcome the fear of death:*We all know that one day we have to leave this world. Still we are afraid of death. We think that our spouse and children will be unable to withstand our loss. But the truth is no one is going to die for you; they may be depressed for some time.

Fat can never be converted into a muscle.*Qn3.* It's still a grave shock to hear that some apparently healthy persongets a cardiac arrest. How do we understand it in perspective?*Ans:* This is called silent attack; that is why we recommend everyone past the age of 30 to undergo routine health checkups.*Qn4.* Are heart diseases hereditary?Ans: Yes.*Qn5.* What are the ways in which the heart is stressed? What practices do you suggest to de-stress?*Ans:* Change your attitude towards life. Do not look for perfection in everything in life.*Qn6.* Is walking better than jogging or is more intensive exercise required to keep a healthy heart?*Ans:* Walking is better than jogging, since jogging leads to early fatigue and injury to joints.*Qn7.* You have done so much for the poor and needy. What has inspired you to do so?*Ans:* Mother Teressa, who was my patient.*Qn8.* Can people with low blood pressure suffer heart diseases?*Ans:* Extremely rare.*Qn9.* Does cholesterol accumulate right from an early age (I'm currently only 22) or do you have to worry about it only after you are above 30 years of age?*Ans:* Cholesterol accumulates from childhood.*Qn10.* How do irregular eating habits affect the heart ?*Ans:* You tend to eat junk food when the habits are irregular and your body's enzyme release for digestion gets confused.*Qn11.* How can I control cholesterol content without using medicines?*Ans:* Control diet, walk and eat walnut.*Qn12.* Which is the best and worst food for the heart?*Ans:* Fruits and vegetables are the best and oil is the worst.*Qn13.* Which oil is better - groundnut, sunflower, olive?*Ans:* Oils do no good for humans.*Qn14.* What is the routine checkup one should go through? Is there any specific test?Ans: Routine blood test to ensure sugar, cholesterol is ok. Check BP, Treadmill test after an echo.*Qn15.* What are the first aid steps to be taken on a heart attack?*Ans:* Help the person into a sleeping position, place an aspirin tablet under the tongue with a sorbitrate tablet if available, and rush him to a coronary care unit, since the maximum casualty takes place within the first hour.*Qn17.* What is the main cause of a steep increase in heart problems amongst youngsters? I see people of about 30-40 yrs of age having heart attacks and serious heart problems.*Ans*: Increased awareness has increased incidents. Also, sedentary lifestyles, smoking, junk food, lack of exercise in a country where people are genetically three times more vulnerable for heart attacks than Europeans and Americans.*Please, don't hoard knowledge.**Do send it to all your friends and relatives.*",1,1,1,1,1,1

7469,"*WEDDING IN RUSSIA*By Sudha  Narayan MurthyWife of Mr NarayanMurthy,  Infosys )She writes:Recently I was in Moscow, Russia.The Day I Went to the Park, it was a Sunday. It was Drizzling and Cold, though it was Summer. I was Standing under an Umbrella and Enjoying the Beauty of the Place... when Suddenly, My Eyes Fell on a Young Couple.It Was Apparent that They Had Just Got Married.The Girl was in Her Mid-Twenties, Slim and with Blonde Hair and Sparkling Blue Eyes. She Was Very Beautiful Indeed.The Boy Was almost the Same Age and Very Handsome. He Was in a Military Uniform.The Bride was Wearing a Pretty White Satin Dress, Decorated with Pearls and Pretty Laces.Two Young Bridesmaids were Standing Behind Her Holding up the Hem of the Wedding Gown, so as not to let it get Dirtied.One Young Boy was Holding an Umbrella Over Their Heads, so that They Should Not Get Drenched.The Girl was Holding a Bouquet and the Two Were Standing with Their Arms Linked.It Was a Beautiful Sight. I  Wondered why They Had Come to the Park in This Rain Soon After Getting Married. They Could Surely Have Gone to a Merrier Place.I Watched as They Walked Together to the Raised Platform Near the Memorial, placed the Bouquet, Bowed their Heads in Silence, and Slowly Walked Back.By Now I was  Curious to Know as to What Was Going On...There was an Old Man Standing With Them. He Looked at Me, My Saree, and asked, ‘Are you Indian ?’I replied, ‘Yes, I am an Indian.’And We Began Chatting Amicably. I Decided to use the Opportunity to ask some Questions. - ‘ How Do You Come to Know English ?’ - ‘ Oh, I Worked Abroad.' - ‘ Please Tell Me Why that Young Couple Visited the War Memorial on Their Wedding Day ?’ - ‘ Oh, that is the Custom in Russia. The Wedding takes Place Normally on a Saturday or a Sunday.'Irrespective of the Season, after Signing the Register at the Marriage Office, Married Couples Must visit the Important National Monuments Nearby.'Every Boy in this Country Has to Serve in the Military for a Couple of Years at Least.Regardless of His Position, He Must Wear His Service Uniform for the Wedding.’ ‘Why is That ?’ 'This is a Mark of Gratitude.Our Forefathers Have Given their Lives in Various Wars That Russia Has Fought.Some of Them We Won, and Some We Lost, But Their Sacrifice Was Always for the Country.The Newly Married Couple Needs to Remember That They are Living in a Peaceful, Independent Russia Because of Their Ancestors’ Sacrifices. They Must Ask for Their Blessings.'Love for the Country is More Important Than Wedding Celebrations.We Elders Insist on Continuing with this Tradition Whether it be in Moscow, St. Petersburg or any other Part of Russia.On the Wedding Day They Have to Visit the Nearest War Memorial.’This Set Me Wondering about What We Teach Our Children Here.Do We Indians Have the Courtesy to Remember Our Martyrs on the Most Important Day of our Lives ?We are Busy Shopping for Sarees, Buying Jewellery and Planning & Preparing Elaborate Menus and Partying in Discos etc..My Eyes filled with Tears at the Thought.. and I Wished that We Indians Could Learn a Lesson From the Russians in This Noble Thought and Custom..And We Too Could  Respect Our Martyrs Who Sacrificed Their Lives For Our Nation.. and For Our Today and Tomorrow Too...And From the Heart...!🙏🙏If You Agree With The Sentiment please do Share ...",1,1,1,1,1,1

7481,"*Give 'em A Bloody Nose*By S BalakrishnanThe deadly terror attack by the Pakistani outfit Jaish e Mohammed on a CRPF convoy killing 20 jawans and critically injuring many more today should be treated by the Modi government as an act of war by Islamabad.The so-called surgical strike has obviously had no impact on the Pakistani govt.The Modi govt's Kashmir policy , howsoever well-intentioned, has failed to tackle the situation. The need is for a full-fledged muscular policy in which the army other security forces should be given a carte blanche to neutralise Pakistan's machinations. Anyone chanting pro-Pak slogans should be summarily be gunned down. Ditto treatment to stone-pelters too. You cannot support Pakistan and yet demand civil liberties guaranteed by the Induan Constitution. This is at the military level.At the political level Articled 35a and 370 should scrapped through ordinances. The government can legally do that.And elsewhere in the country jihadi fundamental outfits like the PDF should be banned. Elements working for D Company should be encountered. The IB has submitted tapes of a prominent Mumbai builder's conversations with a Jaish e Mohammed operator in Lahore. Yet no action against him. A massive real estate project in Mumbai is being executed by a front organization of D Company. FIRs for murder registered against armymen in Kashmir and the totally untenable case filed against a brilliant officer like Lt Col Purohit should be withdrawn forthwith. These and counter-terror measures deep inside Pakistan will teach Islamabad a lesson. Time we gave a bloody nose to Pakistan./////////",1,1,1,1,1,1

7502,"* master Piece of doctor 🍾👏🎯💯🥃👌 ** Dr. Patxi Ulibarri is the Medical Director of a Bilbao Hospital in Bizkaia Spain.* This is the extract of an interview on local TV, where he was asked about food and sports issues ...*Here it goes...** Question: Cardiovascular exercises prolong life ... Is it true?* Answer: Your heart was made to beat a certain number of times and go ... Do not waste those beats in exercises ... Eventually, everything is spent. Accelerating your heart will not make you live longer: That's like saying that you can prolong the life of your car by driving faster. Do you want to live longer? Take a nap. ** Q: Should I stop eating red meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?* A: You need to understand the logistics of efficiency. What does the Lamb eat? Grass, fodder and legumes. What are those things? Vegetables! Then a barbecue or a barbecue is nothing more than an effective mechanism to place vegetables in your system. Do you need grains? Eat chicken! ** Q: Should I reduce my alcohol consumption?* A: No way. Wine is made of fruit. Brandy is a distilled wine, which means that they take the water out of the fruit and thus one takes advantage of it better. Beer is also made from grains ... Get drunk! ** Q: What are the advantages of a regular exercise program?* A: My philosophy is: If nothing hurts you, you're fine and you do not have to do anything. ** Q: Are fried foods harmful?* A: YOU ARE NOT LISTENING TO ME !! Today the food is fried in vegetable oil. These foods are literally impregnated with ""vegetable"" oil ... How can something vegetable be harmful to your health? ** Q: Do push-ups help reduce fat?* A: Absolutely NO! Exercising a muscle only causes it to increase in size. ** Q: Does chocolate do badly?* A: Are you crazy? Cocoa, another vegetable! It is a very good meal to be happy. *AND REMEMBER*:* Life should not be a trip to the grave, with the intention of getting there safe and sound with an attractive body and well preserved ... Better to exceed: Beer in one hand, appetizer in the other, much sex and a body totally spent, completely used and screaming: It was worth it !! WHAT TRIP!!!*- If walking was healthy, the postman would be immortal.- The whale swims all day, only eats fish, only takes water ... and is fat !!- The rabbit eats well, runs, jumps and lives only 15 years.- The turtle does not run or do anything ... * And lives 450 years! ** If you can not find half of your orange, do not be discouraged ... Look for half a lemon, add rum, ice, coke, and ...*Be Happy** Enjoy your Life !!! *👏👏👏👏👏👏",1,1,1,1,1,1

7526,"When women are changing, men ought to change or prepare themselves for the change.In an evolving world girls/women are changing..........boys/men need to change too....,For at least two generations now – especially in urban India and educated middle-class families – we have raised our girls to be confident and fight for their rights. But we seem to have ignored an entire generation of boys who were not told anything about how their sisters were changing. While we gave our daughters new ideals and role models, no one bothered to tell their brothers that they ought to change too!Girls drive two-wheelers and cars. It is considered an essential life skill. You can often hear dads proudly proclaiming that their daughters can drive very well indeed and they don’t need a father/husband/brother to take them anywhere.However, boys were never taught that cooking is an essential life skill. You don’t see parents proudly saying that their son can cook and doesn’t need a mother/wife/sister to feed him (and keep him alive!).We don’t tell our sons that it is okay for them to be paid less than their wives or stay at home to take care of the kids while their spouses continue to work.Men want to marry a working woman (in theory) but are completely unprepared for the practical reality of a marriage where both partners work. It means doing the dishes or supervising the maid when your wife has a report to complete, it means taking half the day off to take care of your sick son because your wife has an important presentation. It may even mean giving up a promotion or moving to a new city for your spouse’s career.Because we don’t tell our sons all this, they continue to expect that their wife will automatically give up the job/promotion/transfer in favour of the family whereas they will never have to take a step back from their own careers.Boys are still raised the way they were for the last many generations.Women are upset that dinner – and the house, kids, in-laws, maid – is still their responsibility while the men don’t know what they did wrong. After all, they ‘allow’ their wives to work, what more do they want?*Let us not only empower women, but also prepare men to set their expectations right*. ---Great article had to share👍🏻",1,1,1,1,1,1

7529,"*How Emotions Affect Our Health*Every cell in our body is intelligent to think and act. We have *60 trillion* cells in our body and our health depends a lot on the harmonic balance and cohesion of the cells with each other.In the movie _Eat, Pray, Love_, Julia Roberts visits a wise man in Bali, and he advises her not to try too hard to meditate. In fact, he suggests that meditation is nothing but smiling and the line that is a kicker, is ""Smile with your liver.""If you believe that this is just a metaphor, lets look at the other end of the spectrum to prove just how crucial this is.Let us say you hold a negative emotion towards somebody, something or some event in your life. Each time you think of that your whole body re-lives the emotional upheaval of that association.Your mind doesn't have a mind of its own, and doesn't know if the event is happening in real time or it is being replayed. So it produces the same stress hormones each time. Each and every cell of your body starts feeling the same emotion, of let us say ""hatred"" towards that event, person or experience all over again.The body is not at ease. This is a state where the condition of disease sets in.If you continue to live in that state, your cells are now getting conditioned to live in the same state.The Upanishads talk about *""Yatha Pinde Tatha Brahmande""* ...as is the atom so is the universe.The health of a person depends on how well all the systems of the body and the *60 trillion cells* play the melody of harmony together.When the cells are living in a state of hatred, they soon start exhibiting that with each other and killing healthy cells in the body. This leads to many forms of auto immune disease.Like Rumi said, ""you are not a drop in the ocean, you are an ocean in every drop"".Be careful of your thoughts, your feelings and your emotions.*Forgive people, not because they deserve it, but because you need it. Stay happy, stay healthy.* Have a wonderful healthy life ahead filled with the abundance of good health and happiness.*HAPPINESS  TO ALL*",1,1,1,1,1,1

They go into a bar, order two whiskeys, and when the bartender tells them the price, the second drunk drops to his knees and sucks on the hot dog. The bartender throws them out and tells them not to come back. The drunks go on to hit 19 bars.

He thought he was a failure. What he didn't know was that his friend was a driver and had been sent to run errands with his boss's car.  Rosemary nagged her husband always for not being romantic. She accused him for not getting down to open the car door for her as her friend Jane's husband did when he dropped her off at work. What Rosemary didn't know was that Jane's husband's car had a faulty door that could be opened only from outside.   Sampson's wife went to visit one of her long time friends and was very troubled on seeing the 3 lovely kids of her friend playing around. Her problem was that she had only one child and have been struggling to conceive for the past five years.  What she didn't know was that one of those kids who was the biological child of her friend had sickle cell and had just a year to live; the other two were adopted.  Life does not have a universal measuring tool, so looking at people and comparing yourself with them will not make you better. Because you may not know that you have lots of blessings that others will envy for. Enjoy what you have, you have just one life.. Happiness doesn't come from having everything, but happiness is making the best out of what we have, it's all about how we see ourselves.. Count your blessings rather than complaining about the smaller holes. Because.... ""Happiness is a state of mind !!""",1,1,1,1,1,1
